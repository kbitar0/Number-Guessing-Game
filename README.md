#This code will first select a random integer and assign it to the variable "prize". 
#It will then take the bids of 4 different players and use if statements to compare them to the actual number. 
#The winner will be determined by whoevers guess was closest to the actual number. If someone guesses the exact number, they also win an additional 500 dollars. 
#If their guess goes over the actual value, they lose.
